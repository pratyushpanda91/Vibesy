  - `npm run build` (frontend) → Installs dependencies and builds the frontend
  - `npm start` (backend) → Runs the Express backend, serving frontend via static files

🔑 Environment Variables (set in Render Dashboard):

PORT, MONGODB_URI, JWT_SECRET

CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME, CLOUDINARY_API_KEY, CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET
- 🔑 **Environment Variables** set via Render dashboard:
  - `MONGODB_URI`, `JWT_SECRET`
  - `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`, `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY`, `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET`

👉 **Why Render?**  
It’s dev-friendly, supports auto-deploys from GitHub, handles monorepos well, and includes a generous free tier.
